/// This is a helper class that stores a fact that is known at a

/// along with additional information, such as where it was acquired, whether
/// it is exclusive or shared, etc.
///
/// A capability's facts come in two forms, and a FactSet keeps them apart:
///
///  * At most one *definite* fact per capability: the capability is held (or,
///    for a negative capability, provably not held). Its reentrancy depth
///    counts the levels acquired on top of the first; definite levels are
///    interchangeable -- releasing "a" level is releasing "the" level -- so
///    a counter is all they need. A definite fact says nothing about how
///    its hold was established.
///
///  * Any number of *try facts* per capability (TryFactEntry), one per
///    originating try-acquire call and lock kind: what that call's stored
///    result says about the capability. An unresolved try fact is
///    *conditional* -- "held if that call succeeded" -- and a branch on the
///    call's result resolves exactly the try facts that name it as their
///    origin. A resolved try fact stays behind as the record of what the
///    branch proved (see TryFactEntry::State); a scope object releases
///    exactly the try facts it created.
///
/// A capability is *held* if a definite fact exists, *may be held* if only
/// conditional try facts exist, and *not held* if neither does. A resolved
/// try fact is neither a hold nor a not-hold: it is a statement about a
/// result, and every lookup asking about holds skips it. Every lookup says
/// which form it asks for (FactSet::findDefinite(), FactSet::findTryFact(),
/// ...) rather than taking whichever fact the set lists first.
///
/// Per capability that gives a ternary state: not-held, conditional (only
/// conditional try facts), or held. Permitted transitions:
///
///   not-held -----acquire----------------------------------------> held
///   not-held -----try-acquire (BuildLockset::handleCall)---------> conditional
///   conditional --branch on the try-acquire result: success edge-> held
///   conditional --branch on the try-acquire result: failure edge-> not-held
///   conditional --acquire or assert (addLock)--------------------> held
///   held ---------join with a failed path of the same try-acquire,
///                 when the join rebranches on its result
///                 (intersectAndWarn)-----------------------------> conditional
///   held ---------release----------------------------------------> not-held
///
/// The forms compose: a try-acquire over a held capability -- whatever its
/// reentrancy, since at runtime such a call fails rather than deadlocks --
/// adds a conditional try fact beside the definite fact, and a reentrant
/// acquire over a conditionally held capability adds the definite fact beside
/// the try facts. A branch's success edge folds the resolved try fact into the
/// definite fact (one level deeper, or created) and keeps the try fact as the
/// proof of that level, the failure edge drops it, and a release unwinds the
/// definite fact one level.
///
/// Conditionally held means "held if the try-acquire succeeded", so it warns
/// wherever a definite state is required: it does not satisfy capability
/// requirements, it violates exclusions and negative requirements,
/// releasing it warns (may not be held), and a blocking acquire of it
/// warns (may already be held). Asserts and same-kind reentrant acquires are
/// exempt from the acquire warning: they legitimately acquire a
/// possibly-held capability. An acquire of the other kind (shared vs.
/// exclusive) warns even for a reentrant capability: reentrancy nests
/// levels of one kind. Two unresolved try-acquires of one capability are
/// tracked as two try facts, each resolved by the branch on its own
/// result; a repeat of the same call over its own unresolved try fact
/// cannot be, and is diagnosed at the call.
///
/// When the analysis loses track of a conditionally held try fact -- at a join
/// with a path that does not hold it, or at the end of the function -- the
/// try-acquire result was never checked and the capability may be leaked; this
/// is diagnosed in beta mode.

//
// This is essentially a simpler and more naive version of the standard SSA
// algorithm.  Those definitions that remain in the intersection are from blocks
// that strictly dominate the current block.  We do not bother to insert proper
// phi nodes, because they are not used in our analysis; instead, wherever
// a phi node would be required, we simply remove that definition from the
// context (E.g. x above).
//
// The initial traversal does not capture back-edges, so those need to be
// handled on a separate pass.  Whenever the first pass encounters an
// incoming back edge, it duplicates the context, creating new definitions
// that refer back to the originals.  (These correspond to places where SSA
// might have to insert a phi node.)  On the second pass, these definitions are
// set to NULL if the variable has changed on the back-edge (i.e. a phi
// node was actually required.)  E.g.
//
//                       { Context           | VarDefinitions }
//   int x = 0, y = 0;   { x -> x1, y -> y1  | y1 = 0, x1 = 0 }
//   while (b)           { x -> x2, y -> y1  | [1st:] x2=x1; [2nd:] x2=NULL; }
//     x = x+1;          { x -> x3, y -> y1  | x3 = x2 + 1, ... }
